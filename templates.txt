I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I've become my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly
I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shattered through me like a rifle was a revival
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize
What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival, this is my revival
This is a revival
Don't know where I'll go next 
My mind is spinning around 
Got all this knowledge 
Just wanna shout out
