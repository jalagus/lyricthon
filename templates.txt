It's my, my, my time to butterfly
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
I want it all day long
Just wanna shout out 
I admit, it's been painful, painful
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
I'm on your magical mystery ride
I feel like I've awakened lately
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
Hm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
My mind is spinning around 
They can imitate you
I'll burn through my skin
I try to talk to you but you never even knew
I've been under self-restoration
I've become my own salvation
Cause you got something special
That makes me wanna taste you
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
I'm addicted like it's
What I've learned is so vital
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
But they can't duplicate you
Don't know where I'll go next 
Cause you got something special
Cause I'm so well traveled
The chains around me are finally breaking
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
And in this orchard there was a hold
I'm addicted like it's wrong
This is a revival
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
Remember that with every piece of you
What's going on in that beautiful mind
More than just survival
This is my revival, this is my revival
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
Got all this knowledge 
I want it all day long
What shattered through me like a rifle was a revival
Nodding your head, don't hear a word I said
That was hanged with purple and gold
At home people embrace me as a friend
And it was hanged with chords of red
Cause it'll never be over, until you tell me it's over
And it's the only thing that I know, know
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
Cause the world keeps calling me
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Never stay too long
And in that hold there was a bed
I swear it will get easier,
And I'm loving all the energy
I think it's time to go
Can't communicate, when you wait, don't relate
What would I do without your smart mouth
It's my, my, my time to realize
The light inside me is bursting, shining
So what's it gonna be, tell me, can you hear me?
I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I don't know where this journey will end
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
